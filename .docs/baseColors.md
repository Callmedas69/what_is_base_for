# **Using Color**

The core combination is grayscale + Base Blue.
Secondary colors enrich marketing and social content but should never dominate the core palette.

---

## **Core**

Primary color hierarchy:

* Blue
* Black
* White
* Grays

---

## **Marketing / Social**

Add expression using secondary palette responsibly.

---

## **Novelty**

Campaigns and special projects may use extended colors beyond the core brand palette.

---

# **Using Secondary Color**

* Use secondary colors only after black, white, and blue.
* Avoid more than 3 vibrant colors at once.
* Always pair brights with at least one muted tone.

Examples:

* **1 Color**
* **2 Colors**
* **3 Colors (Analogous)**
* **Multicolor**

---

# **Using Color on Web**

* Avoid overly saturated, poppy compositions.
* Use Base Blue sparingly for highest impact.
* Grayscale and negative space should dominate.
* Introduce bursts of color in specific moments to create expression.

---

# **Color Interaction & Legibility**

* Avoid jarring or low-contrast combinations.
* Follow WCAG AA Large accessibility standards.
* Prioritize readability and inclusivity.

---

# **Product Palette**

The product interface uses an accessibility-optimized palette.
Consult product team for full spectrum usage.

---

# **Misuse**

Avoid the following:

* Gradients in core communications
* Opacity, stacking, and unnecessary effects
* Leading with secondary colors
* Overusing Base Blue
* Making the palette feel too elementary

---

# **In Use**

Examples include:

* **Out-of-home marketing**: Heavy use of Base Blue for recognition
* **Image treatments**: Color overlays + texture
* **Infographics**: Structured core + secondary colors
* **Social**: Full palette for expressive identity
