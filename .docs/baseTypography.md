Introducing Base Sans
Base Sans is the primary typeface of Base. It is at the heart of our identity and is purpose built for legibility and adaptability in the fast moving onchain world. Its open counters echo the Square's geometry.
Base Mono complements Base Sans, and is meant for setting metadata, code blocks, and for display purposes in more developer-facing contexts.

Character Set
Base Sans contains a complete extended Latin set: uppercase, lowercase, numerals, punctuation, and dedicated crypto symbols. Tabular figures align in data columns, diacritics are harmonized to the x‑height, and ligatures are off by default for code clarity. The font ships many language presets so global products render consistently. Reference this chart before subsetting for web to keep load times tight while preserving essential glyphs.

Features
Base Sans is based on Modern Gothic, and includes unique customizations and alternative glyphs that makes it more ownable to Base, and more legible. Several letters were given a more geometric structure, to have better flow, consistency and appropriateness to the brand. In addition, there is a set of unique alternate shapes for the b, h, m, n, r, u and the symbols that are decisively geometric and are means for occasional display purposes, especially in developers setting.

Accessing Brand Elements
For most uses, please use our official vector assets or figma components. However, all of Base's core brand elements are also embedded in our custom Base typefaces for quick access, and for easily composing live text lockups in Adobe, Figma, on the web and in product. When creating branded lockups using these embedded assets, make sure to adhere to all scaling and spacing requirements. (outlined on p. 22, 75, 115) The features are accessible via a custom Stylistic Set (see below) and are activated by typing the strings on this slide.
Note: When composing a logo lockup using the two separate elements of <square> and <logotype>, add a space character between the elements and give it a negative spacing of -27.7% in order to match the required spacing.
